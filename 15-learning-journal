#15th Class Learning Journal

In today's class, we went over stuff that we will be covering in more detail in
the 301 course, like jquery to search websites. Also how to use github to create a
website that anyone can see of your code.

In the previous class, CSS was the focus of the lectures, and we saw how animations
can make or break a page's readability. I used the grow animation with the state
hover on my lab bus-mall, so when you hover over the pictures, it grows in size.
