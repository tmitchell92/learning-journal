#12th Learning Journal

We went over yesterdays lab assignment, focused on going over the tricky part
of getting no duplicate images from the previous page. By splicing the images
that were displayed, it forces the random image picker to select none of those.
Also went over chart.js, a library to create charts, which will be used in the
lab assignment.
