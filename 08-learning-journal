# Eighth Learning Journal

In class, the focus was on inputs, basically how to have a user add inputs to
a table. Using that input, we add another row of data and append that to our
current table. The lab was more productive than the previous days, as I was
able to get the input to work relatively quickly. Getting the rows to show up
correctly took more help and work but I feel I've learned about appending table
data together.
