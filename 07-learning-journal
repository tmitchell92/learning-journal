# Seventh Learning Journal

Today we learned about constructors, which makes objects with similar properties
easier to create, manage, and use. The code review showed easier ways to code
than what I managed to create. I had trouble with displaying my values of the cookies
to the browser, in particular creating new columns of data. Hopefully I can see
where I went wrong in the next code review.
