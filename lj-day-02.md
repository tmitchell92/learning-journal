# First learning Journal
In the second day of class, I've learned about the trim statement, used to remove unwanted
spaces from the outerside of strings. Also we have extensively talked about git and github,
and the importance as well as the convenience of ACP when you reach a milestone or standard
in your code.

The assignment checks that you understand how to use git and github, as well as reinforcing
and practicing writing good code format, in that you should use semi-colons and the double space.
So far I am able to follow along the class well enough, no complaints.
