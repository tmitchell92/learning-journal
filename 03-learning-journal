# Third learning Journal
For the third class, we went over for loops and if statements for the most part.
Also, with the && and || operators, which differ in uses as the && is for when
you want the for loop to only run when both conditions are true, while the ||
operators will run as long as one as the conditions are true.

For the assignment, I had got stuck on getting the loop to stop when the correct
input was given. I found out after asking for help that I had misused the ||
operator, and should have used the && operator for my loop. After this was fixed,
the rest of the assignment went smoothly.
